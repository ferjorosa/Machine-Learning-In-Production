### Which factors substantially complicate production machine learning? 
* Model Retraining driven by declining model performance
* Labeling through Weak Supervision

### Direct Labeling is one of the methods used in production ML to label data. About it we can say that: 
* It captures strong label signals
* It needs to match prediction results with their corresponding original inference request.

### A cardiologist labeling MRI images is a typical example of Direct Labeling.
* False. MRI labeling by a medical specialist is an example of Human Labeling
