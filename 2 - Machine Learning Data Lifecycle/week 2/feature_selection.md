### Consider a binary classification problem in a 2D  feature space. What is the shape of the boundary separating the 2 classes in an ideal setting?
* Linear. 

### Feature selection is characterized by:
* Identify features that best represent the relationship between two or more variables.
* Remove features that donâ€™t influence the outcome.

### What is the definition of backward elimination?
* In this method we start by selecting all the features. We then remove the least significant feature based on model performance. We repeat this step until no improvement is observed in model performance.

### Embedded methods combine the best of both worlds, filter and wrapper methods. Embedded methods are:
* More efficient than filter methods. Filter methods suffer from inefficiencies as they need to look at all the possible feature subsets.
* Faster than wrapper methods. Wrapper methods are based  on the greedy algorithm and thus solutions are slow to compute.
