### Stages of the machine learning project lifecycle?
* Scoping
* Data
* Modeling
* Deployment

### Advantages of edge deployment compared to a typical cloud deployment?
* Can function even if network connection is down
* Less network bandwith needed
* More computational power available

### Disadvantages?
* Edge deployments are frequently constrained in computational power due to cost, size, and energy requirements of the hardware. 

### In the speech recognition example, what is the problem with some labelers transcribing audio as “Um, today’s weather” and others transcribing “Umm..., today’s weather”?

* Either transcription is okay, but the inconsistency is problematic. The labelling instructions should remove ambiguity such that every example is labelled consistently. 

### After a system is deployed, monitoring and maintaining the system will help us handle cases of concept drift or data drift.
* True

### Full cycle of a machine learning project
* It is an iterative process, where during a later stage we might go back to an earlier stage. (That’s why we call it a cycle--it’s a circular process.)
